Working with Incumbent Solutions
--------------------------------

Incumbent solutions are intermediate feasible solutions found during the MIP solving process. They represent the best integer-feasible solution discovered so far and can be accessed through callback functions.

.. note::
    Incumbent solutions are only available for Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problems, not for pure Linear Programming (LP) problems.

Working with PDLP Warmstart Data
--------------------------------

Warmstart data allows to restart PDLP with a previous solution context. This should be used when you solve a new problem which is similar to the previous one.

.. note::
    Warmstart data is only available for Linear Programming (LP) problems, not for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems.
