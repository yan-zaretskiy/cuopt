MILP C API Examples
===================


Example With Data
-----------------

This example demonstrates how to use the MILP solver in C. More details on the API can be found in :doc:`C API <lp-qp-milp-c-api>`.

The example code is available at ``../lp-milp/examples/simple_milp_example.c`` (:download:`download <examples/simple_milp_example.c>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/simple_milp_example.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:

It is necessary to have the path for include and library dirs ready, if you know the paths, please add them to the path variables directly. Otherwise, run the following commands to find the path and assign it to the path variables.
The following commands are for Linux and might fail in cases where the cuopt library is not installed or there are multiple cuopt libraries in the system.

If you have built it locally, libcuopt.so will be in the build directory ``cpp/build`` and include directoy would be ``cpp/include``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Find the cuopt header file and assign to INCLUDE_PATH
   INCLUDE_PATH=$(find / -name "cuopt_c.h" -path "*/linear_programming/*" -printf "%h\n" | sed 's/\/linear_programming//' 2>/dev/null)
   # Find the libcuopt library and assign to LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH
   LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find / -name "libcuopt.so" 2>/dev/null)


Build and run the example

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build and run the example
   gcc -I $INCLUDE_PATH -L $LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH -o simple_milp_example simple_milp_example.c -lcuopt
   ./simple_milp_example



You should see the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

Example With MPS File
---------------------

This example demonstrates how to use the cuOpt solver in C to solve an MPS file.

The example code is available at ``examples/milp_mps_example.c`` (:download:`download <examples/milp_mps_example.c>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/milp_mps_example.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:

It is necessary to have the path for include and library dirs ready, if you know the paths, please add them to the path variables directly. Otherwise, run the following commands to find the path and assign it to the path variables.
The following commands are for Linux and might fail in cases where the cuopt library is not installed or there are multiple cuopt libraries in the system.

If you have built it locally, libcuopt.so will be in the build directory ``cpp/build`` and include directoy would be ``cpp/include``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Find the cuopt header file and assign to INCLUDE_PATH
   INCLUDE_PATH=$(find / -name "cuopt_c.h" -path "*/linear_programming/*" -printf "%h\n" | sed 's/\/linear_programming//' 2>/dev/null)
   # Find the libcuopt library and assign to LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH
   LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find / -name "libcuopt.so" 2>/dev/null)

A sample MILP MPS file (:download:`download mip_sample.mps <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY/master/Datasets/sample.mps>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/mip_sample.mps
   :language: text
   :linenos:

Build and run the example

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build and run the example
   gcc -I $INCLUDE_PATH -L $LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH -o milp_mps_example milp_mps_example.c -lcuopt
   ./milp_mps_example mip_sample.mps
