LP/QP C API Examples
====================


Example With Data
-----------------

This example demonstrates how to use the LP solver in C. More details on the API can be found in :doc:`C API <lp-qp-milp-c-api>`.

The example code is available at ``examples/cuopt-c/lp/simple_lp_example.c`` (:download:`download <examples/simple_lp_example.c>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/simple_lp_example.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:

It is necessary to have the path for include and library dirs ready, if you know the paths, please add them to the path variables directly. Otherwise, run the following commands to find the path and assign it to the path variables.
The following commands are for Linux and might fail in cases where the cuopt library is not installed or there are multiple cuopt libraries in the system.

If you have built it locally, libcuopt.so will be in the build directory ``cpp/build`` and include directoy would be ``cpp/include``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Find the cuopt header file and assign to INCLUDE_PATH
   INCLUDE_PATH=$(find / -name "cuopt_c.h" -path "*/linear_programming/*" -printf "%h\n" | sed 's/\/linear_programming//' 2>/dev/null)
   # Find the libcuopt library and assign to LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH
   LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find / -name "libcuopt.so" 2>/dev/null)


Build and run the example

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build and run the example
   gcc -I $INCLUDE_PATH -L $LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH -o simple_lp_example simple_lp_example.c -lcuopt
   ./simple_lp_example



You should see the following output:

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Output

Example With MPS File
---------------------

This example demonstrates how to use the cuOpt linear programming solver in C to solve an MPS file.

The example code is available at ``examples/cuopt-c/lp/mps_file_example.c`` (:download:`download <examples/mps_file_example.c>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/mps_file_example.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:

It is necessary to have the path for include and library dirs ready, if you know the paths, please add them to the path variables directly. Otherwise, run the following commands to find the path and assign it to the path variables.

If you have built it locally, libcuopt.so will be in the build directory ``cpp/build`` and include directoy would be ``cpp/include``.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Find the cuopt header file and assign to INCLUDE_PATH
   INCLUDE_PATH=$(find / -name "cuopt_c.h" -path "*/linear_programming/*" -printf "%h\n" | sed 's/\/linear_programming//' 2>/dev/null)
   # Find the libcuopt library and assign to LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH
   LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find / -name "libcuopt.so" 2>/dev/null)

A sample MPS file (:download:`download sample.mps <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BUGSENG/PPL/devel/demos/ppl_lpsol/examples/sample.mps>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/sample.mps
   :language: text
   :linenos:

Build and run the example

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build and run the example
   gcc -I $INCLUDE_PATH -L $LIBCUOPT_LIBRARY_PATH -o mps_file_example mps_file_example.c -lcuopt
   ./mps_file_example sample.mps
